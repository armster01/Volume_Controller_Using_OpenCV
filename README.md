# Volume Controller using OpenCV 🎵🔊

This project is a **hand gesture-based volume controller** built using **OpenCV** and **Python**. It allows users to **control system volume** using hand movements detected by a webcam.

## 🚀 Features
- Control system volume using hand gestures.
- Uses **OpenCV** for real-time hand tracking.
- Works with **MediaPipe Hands** for gesture recognition.
- Adjusts volume dynamically based on finger distance.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **OpenCV** (Computer Vision)
- **MediaPipe** (Hand Tracking)
- **PyCaw** (For controlling system volume)
- **NumPy** (Data processing)

## How It Works?
- The webcam captures hand gestures.
- The index finger and thumb distance determines the volume level.
- The system volume is adjusted in real-time based on the detected distance.
- Displays a volume bar and percentage on the screen.
